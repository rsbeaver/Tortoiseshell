This is the Tortoiseshell Optics project for Codecademy's CodeReady  HTML / CSS lessons.
Took some time to get caught up, and more time to make it work correctly. It became much
easier after I finished the Colmar Academy project; I was able to apply much of the information
from that project to this one.
